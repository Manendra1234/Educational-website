    Artificial Neural Network Tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of ANNs. Our Artificial Neural Network tutorial is developed for beginners as well as professions.

The term "Artificial neural network" refers to a biologically inspired sub-field of artificial intelligence modeled after the brain. An Artificial neural network is usually a computational network based on biological neural networks that construct the structure of the human brain. Similar to a human brain has neurons interconnected to each other, artificial neural networks also have neurons that are linked to each other in various layers of the networks. These neurons are known as nodes.

Artificial neural network tutorial covers all the aspects related to the artificial neural network. In this tutorial, we will discuss ANNs, Adaptive resonance theory, Kohonen self-organizing map, Building blocks, unsupervised learning, Genetic algorithm, etc.
<br>
<h1 style="color: blue;">Artecture of ANN</h1>
The architecture of an artificial neural network:
To understand the concept of the architecture of an artificial neural network, we have to understand what a neural network consists of. In order to define a neural network that consists of a large number of artificial neurons, which are termed units arranged in a sequence of layers. Lets us look at various types of layers available in an artificial neural network.
<br>
<h4>Input Layer:</h4><br>

As the name suggests, it accepts inputs in several different formats provided by the programmer.
<br>
<h4>Hidden Layer:</h4><br>

The hidden layer presents in-between input and output layers. It performs all the calculations to find hidden features and patterns.
<br>

<h4>Output Layer:</h4>
<br>
The input goes through a series of transformations using the hidden layer, which finally results in output that is conveyed using this layer.

The artificial neural network takes input and computes the weighted sum of the inputs and includes a bias. This computation is represented in the form of a transfer function.
<br>
What is Artificial Neural Network
It determines weighted total is passed as an input to an activation function to produce the output. Activation functions choose whether a node should fire or not. Only those who are fired make it to the output layer. There are distinctive activation functions available that can be applied upon the sort of task we are performing.
<br>
<h1 style="color: blue;">How does ANN works</h1><br>
How do artificial neural networks work?
Artificial Neural Network can be best represented as a weighted directed graph, where the artificial neurons form the nodes. The association between the neurons outputs and neuron inputs can be viewed as the directed edges with weights. The Artificial Neural Network receives the input signal from the external source in the form of a pattern and image in the form of a vector. These inputs are then mathematically assigned by the notations x(n) for every n number of inputs.
<br>
Afterward, each of the input is multiplied by its corresponding weights ( these weights are the details utilized by the artificial neural networks to solve a specific problem ). In general terms, these weights normally represent the strength of the interconnection between neurons inside the artificial neural network. All the weighted inputs are summarized inside the computing unit.

If the weighted sum is equal to zero, then bias is added to make the output non-zero or something else to scale up to the system's response. Bias has the same input, and weight equals to 1. Here the total of weighted inputs can be in the range of 0 to positive infinity. Here, to keep the response in the limits of the desired value, a certain maximum value is benchmarked, and the total of weighted inputs is passed through the activation function.

The activation function refers to the set of transfer functions used to achieve the desired output. There is a different kind of the activation function, but primarily either linear or non-linear sets of functions. Some of the commonly used sets of activation functions are the Binary, linear, and Tan hyperbolic sigmoidal activation functions. Let us take a look at each of them in details:<br>
<h1 style="color: blue;">Types of ANN</h1><br>
There are various types of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) depending upon the human brain neuron and network functions, an artificial neural network similarly performs tasks. The majority of the artificial neural networks will have some similarities with a more complex biological partner and are very effective at their expected tasks. For example, segmentation or classification.
<br>
<h4 >Feedback ANN:</h4>
In this type of ANN, the output returns into the network to accomplish the best-evolved results internally. As per the University of Massachusetts, Lowell Centre for Atmospheric Research. The feedback networks feed information back into itself and are well suited to solve optimization issues. The Internal system error corrections utilize feedback ANNs.

<h4 >Feed-Forward ANN:</h4>
A feed-forward network is a basic neural network comprising of an input layer, an output layer, and at least one layer of a neuron. Through assessment of its output by reviewing its input, the intensity of the network can be noticed based on group behavior of the associated neurons, and the output is decided. The primary advantage of this network is that it figures out how to evaluate and recognize input patterns.
